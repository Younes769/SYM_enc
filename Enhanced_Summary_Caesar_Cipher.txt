Enhanced Summary of the Code

This C++ program, developed with the **Raylib** library, serves as an engaging educational tool for teaching the fundamentals of symmetric encryption, focusing on the **Caesar Cipher**. It features two main modes for user interaction:

---

1. Animation Mode
Objective: Provide a dynamic visualization of the encryption and decryption processes.

Key Features:
- Message Transformation:
  - The plaintext message is animated across the screen as it moves between devices (represented by computer icons).
  - It undergoes:
    - Encryption: Letters are shifted forward in the alphabet based on a fixed key.
    - Decryption: Letters are shifted back using the same key.
- Real-Time Feedback:
  - The status of the message (encrypted or decrypted) is displayed with its updated content.
- Interactive Controls:
  - Pause, restart, or exit the simulation using keyboard shortcuts for a seamless experience.

2. Step-by-Step Mode
Objective: Offer an in-depth explanation of how the Caesar Cipher works, with user input and interactive visuals.

Key Features:
- Interactive Learning:
  - Users type a message to see it encrypted step-by-step.
  - Each transformation is explained in detail, highlighting:
    - The concept of symmetric encryption.
    - How individual characters are shifted in the alphabet.
    - Case sensitivity and position calculations.
- Scrollable Interface:
  - Detailed explanations and transformations are presented in a visually organized, scrollable interface.
- Reset Functionality:
  - Users can restart with new inputs for additional practice.

Additional Features
- User-Friendly Navigation:
  - Buttons and mouse-based interactions in the menu for easy mode selection.
- Educational Value:
  - Perfect for beginners, as it simplifies cryptographic concepts through clear visualization.
- Customizable Experience:
  - Options to pause animations, reset simulations, or explore step-by-step details.
